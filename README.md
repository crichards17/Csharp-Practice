# Csharp-Practice

This repo contains a series of practice projects, which I used to ramp into C# and .NET in preparation for work on my [3D Fractal Raytracer](https://github.com/crichards17/3D-Fratal-Raytracer).

## Guessing Game

This is a simple .NET console app . The game prompts the user to guess a number in a predetermined range, and then has them guess higher or lower until the correct answer is reached. This was built primarily following a tutorial and was a handy first dip into C# having worked in Java previously.

## Simple Notes App

This is a Windows Forms app, in which a user can create, review, and delete notes. This was also built primarily using a tutorial, with small feature changes once i'd completed the main application. This was a helpful intro to Forms apps and the VS forms editor (and made me appreciate WPF all the more in the next project).

## TicTacToe

Given my intention to use WPF for my frontend in the above-mentioned Raytracer project, I wanted to take this opportunity to make a WPF-based applet to familiarize myself. What I decided on was a TicTacToe game, inspired by a screenshot of a similar WPF-based game someone else had created. For this one I did not follow any tutorials, only referencing the MS WPF and C# documentation, and this was a great exercise.
